Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.

The Olist sales dataset is a collection of anonymized data about orders placed on the Olist from September 2016 to September 2018. It contains a wide range of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. The dataset also includes information about the sellers who list their products on Olist, as well as data on customer behavior and demographics. The dataset is designed to help analysts and researchers better understand the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and identify opportunities for growth and optimization. In this analysis, the dataset was accessed using SQL and then cleaned and processed using Python.
